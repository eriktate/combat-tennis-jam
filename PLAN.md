# Combat Tennis Jam

## Premise

A hybrid of deathmatch, deck building, and tennis. In a galaxy far, far away interplanetary disputes are resolved by the greatest athelete warriors in existence.

## Gameplay

- Play through matches just like tennis.
- Each game lost in a set kills off some percentage of your homeworld.
- Planets with smaller homeworlds lose faster, while planets with larger homeworlds lose slower.
- You play as the ambassador for a very small planet called Aerth.
- Throughout the match you can use power ups that are drawn from a deck that you must build and maintain as you progress through sets.
- New powerups are won after each match.

## Mechanics

- Swing your racket with a mouse or a thumbstick.
	- The ball will behave differently based on how hard and from what angle you hit it.
- Dive to get to far off shots, but you have to pay a recovery cost.
- LOTS of camera shake :D
- Deck building. You get 20(?) cards per set.
- Cards can be combined to create hybrid cards that give you two upgrades at once, plus a third depending on the combo.
- If you're patient, you can wait until you have two draws and combine the effects of your cards using hybrid cards.
- Multiplayer (couch co-op).
- Hard shots knock your character back, relative to the direction you hit them (e.g. you go in the opposite direction as the ball).
- Courts have no sides, so you can fall off. Don't do that, it's an automatic point for the other player.
- Knockback can be used to force your opponent out.

## Cards

- 2 Swole - Next hit goes 2x, 3x, and 5x as fast. Harder to get to.
	- Stack: 2x whatever number.
- Wumbo - Next hit makes the ball 2x, 3x, and 5x as large. Increased knockback.
	- Stack: 2x whatever number.
- Spaz - Next hit makes the ball bounce in the opposite direction that it should.
	- Stack: Makes the ball bounce toward the net.
- Shock - Electrocutes the opponent and they get little shocks for a time afterwards. Each shock stuns them for like half a second.
	- Stack: Shocks stun for longer. .75 of a second? Needs testing.
- Fancy Footwork - Increases movement speed for some amount of time.
	- Stack: 2x as fast.
- Drone - After the next hit you can control the ball after until the first bounce.
	- Stack: More control over the ball.
- Spectral Racket - Summons a ghost racket that will instantly return any ball.
	- Stack: Two hits. Second one happens before first bounce on opponent side.
	- Any "next hit" cards apply to the spectral racket when used as a hybrid.
- Mad Scientist - Draws two cards and immediately uses a hybrid right away, but takes up a slot in your deck. Good for aggressive strategies.
	- Stack: Double hybrid. No idea what this means yet.
- Quickdraw - Draws three cards in rapid succession, but only after you've used the previous. E.g. you can't get hybrids with this unless you draw a "Mad Scientist".
	- Stack: Draw six cards in rapid succession. Seems OP but...
- Lead Foot - If your opponent returns your next hit, they will be slowed for a time.
	- Stack: Opponent is twice as slow.
- Shock Wave - Emit a pulse every second for a time that pushes your opponent away from you (not hard, just enough to be dangerous if they aren't paying attention).
	- Stack: Either pulse every half second or double the power. Whatever works better.
