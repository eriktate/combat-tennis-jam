# Combat Tennis Jam

## Premise

A hybrid of deathmatch, deck building, and tennis. In a galaxy far, far away interplanetary disputes are resolved by the greatest athelete warriors in existence.

## Gameplay

- Play through matches just like tennis.
- Each game lost in a set kills off some percentage of your homeworld.
- Planets with smaller homeworlds lose faster, while planets with larger homeworlds lose slower.
- You play as the ambassador for a very small planet called Aerth.
- Throughout the match you can use power ups that are drawn from a deck that you must build and maintain as you progress through sets.
- New powerups are won after each match.

## Mechanics

- Swing your racket with a mouse or a thumbstick.
	- The ball will behave differently based on how hard and from what angle you hit it.
- Dive to get to far off shots, but you have to pay a recovery cost.
- LOTS of camera shake :D
- Deck building. You get 20(?) cards per set.
- Cards can be combined to create hybrid cards that give you two upgrades at once, plus a third depending on the combo.
- If you're patient, you can wait until you have two draws and combine the effects of your cards using hybrid cards.

## Cards

- Next hit goes 2x, 3x, and 5x as fast. Harder to get to.
- Next hit makes the ball 2x, 3x, and 5x as large. Increased knockback.
- Next hit makes the ball bounce in the opposite direction that it should.
- Fancy Footwork - Increases movement speed for some amount of time.
- Drone - After the next hit you can control the ball after until the first bounce.
- Spectral Racket - Summons a ghost racket that will instantly return any ball.
	- Any "next hit" cards apply to the spectral racket when used as a hybrid.
- Mad Scientist - Draws two cards and immediately uses a hybrid right away, but takes up a slot in your deck. Good for aggressive strategies.
- Quickdraw - Draws three cards in rapid succession, but only after you've used the previous. E.g. you can't get hybrids with this unless you draw a "Draw Two Cards".
